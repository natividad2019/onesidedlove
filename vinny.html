            One-sided love is a silent storm—unseen, unheard, but deeply felt. It lingers like an unhealed wound, a weight that refuses to lift. You pour your heart into someone, believing in the beauty of what could be, only to realize that love was never truly shared. The hardest truth? What felt real to you was merely an illusion to them. And while they move on effortlessly, you’re left standing in the wreckage of emotions they never even acknowledged.
        </div>

        <p>One-sided love is like carrying a heavy weight in your heart, a wound that never quite heals. It’s a quiet pain that stays with you. You give all of your heart to someone, believing they care for you, only to realize later that it wasn’t meant to be. The truth is hard to face—what seemed real was just an illusion, and the person you loved has moved on.</p>

        <p>It’s like the flame of a candle that refuses to go out or the lingering embers that glow even after the fire has faded—an unyielding warmth that remains, even in times of loss. Love is like this constant flame. Sometimes, it brings light and warmth, and other times, it consumes us. It can be both beautiful and painful at the same time. A loving heart, though shaken by doubt, keeps burning, even in silence.</p>

        <p>Dreams without a future, promises without meaning—these are the things left behind when love isn’t returned. The space between you and the one you love becomes the only truth. It’s a painful realization: How can a love so pure in your heart feel so empty? The hardest part isn’t rejection but the silence—the unanswered questions and feelings that were never shared. How do you heal when the person who hurt you doesn’t even see your pain?</p>

        <p>This unreturned love feels like a curse. It makes you question who you are, what you’re worth, and your purpose. But loving someone isn’t wrong. It’s not a sin to love deeply. What’s wrong is losing yourself in a love that was never yours to begin with. True love doesn’t ask you to forget who you are or leave you feeling lost. It builds you up, not tears you down.</p>

        <p>The world may seem unfair, and the pain can feel unbearable, but life isn’t defined by someone else’s feelings for you. Even if your love is one-sided, it’s still a reflection of your pure heart. Love honestly, but don’t let it take over your life. Your worth isn’t tied to someone who couldn’t see how special your love is.</p>

        <p>In moments of struggle, when you feel like no one understands, it’s easy to wonder: Can anyone truly know what I’m going through? But even in the quietest moments, when love feels unspoken or the pain feels invisible, God knows. He understands the love we keep to ourselves, the hope that quietly burns inside us. And when we struggle, just like the flame that continues to glow even after the fire has faded, He is there to guide us through.</p>

        <p>Keep going with courage. Every day you endure the pain, you grow stronger. Life is a journey, and love is just one part of it. Trust in God, for His love is unchanging and healing. He sees your tears, the prayers you keep to yourself, and your silent struggles. There’s no shame in loving with all your heart, but there’s also freedom in letting go when your love isn’t returned. In time, you will find peace, joy, and someone who will cherish your love as much as you deserve.</p>

        <p>Until that time comes, remember: you are worth so much more than the love you’ve lost. You are not alone. Like an eternal light that never fades, God’s love will carry you through, bringing healing to your heart and new hope each day. Even when life feels heavy, and your heart is burdened by unspoken love, His love will never fade.</p>
